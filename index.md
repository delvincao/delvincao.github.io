# Delvin Cao - Computer Science Major

Hello! My name is Delvin and I am a first year student at Cal State University Fullerton. This is my portfolio where I will be showcasing work throughout my journey.

[Here](https://github.com/delvincao/delvincao.github.io) is where you can find my GitHub page!

## CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was one of my favorite early labs, as  I learned that I wouldn't just be doing my labs with the same partner for the entire semester. We switched partners and I got to work with someone who has an entirely different chemistry compared to my last partner. I also learned that every two labs, we would switch partners. Lab 3 consisted of us moving on to more complicated code, with the intial work put into calculating the date difference. This was the first breakthrough into more complex and sophisticated code, and I learned a lot of valuable lessons from this lab.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a very challenging but fun lab. For the second part, I got to define the rules for parking on certain streets according to signs, which would return if a person was allowed to park at a particular street based on the time of the day, and the day of the week that they inputted to the program. Part 1 would calculate the date difference between two different dates using the Julian date, and the two different dates in particular, and return that output to the user. We had done it before, but this time around, we got to refine the code further, optimizing it even more.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was the introductory lab to the course. This was where we established our GitHub profiles, and created Personal Access Tokens (PATs). It also introduced us to the idea of compiling our code, testing our code for errors, debugging code, checking code for formatting according to the Google C++, and checking and cleaning it of lint to ensure it is easy for others to read and understand. We would be pushing and cleaning up code in this exact manner later on for the semester.
